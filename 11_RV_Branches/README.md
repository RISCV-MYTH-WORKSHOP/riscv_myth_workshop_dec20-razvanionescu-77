## How to use it
The code is adding support to identify branches and calculate branch target address. The visualization can be used to execute the code, which now accumulates the sum of numbers from 1
to 9. A loop is used to compute the sum. Loop is implementing using a branch instruction, that now is decoded correctly and jump to the target pc address. See it for example in Cycle 
22 in Visualization.
