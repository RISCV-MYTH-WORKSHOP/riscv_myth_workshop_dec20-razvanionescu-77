## How to use it
The code is producing a design for a calculator that implements 4 operations: add, substract, multiply and divide. The type of operation is selected using signal $op.
The output signal $out is calculated based on one input $val2 and previous result $out. The implementation shows how multiple time stages can be represented and used for a pipeline design.
