## How to use it
Another great feature in verilog is validity. The signal can be observed in Diagram picture below. It enables operations and automatically generates clock gateing when signals should not be enabled.
Also in Waveform you can easily spot when values for a signal are valid or not. Great feature! It saves a lot of work coding for the same in regular verilog.
